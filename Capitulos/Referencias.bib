  abstract = {Autonomous agents in real-time strategy (RTS) games lack an integrated framework for reasoning about choke points and regions of open space in their environment. This paper presents an algorithm which partitions the environment into a set of polygonal regions and computes optimal choke points between adjacent regions. This representation can be used as a component for AI agents to reason about terrain, plan multiple routes of attack, and make other tactical decisions. The algorithm is tested on a set of popular maps commonly used in international Starcraft competitions and evaluated against answers made by human participants. The algorithm identified 97% of the choke points that the participants found and also identified a number of bottlenecks that human participants did not recognize as choke points.},

  abstract = {In recent years, real-time strategy (RTS) games have gained interest in the AI research community for their multitude of challenging subproblems  such as collaborative pathfinding, effective resource allocation and unit targeting, to name a few. In this paper we consider the build order problem in RTS games in which we need to find concurrent action sequences that, constrained by unit dependencies and resource availability, create a certain number of units and structures in the shortest possible time span. We present abstractions and heuristics that speed up the search for approximative solutions considerably in the game of StarCraft, and show the efficacy of our method by comparing its real-time performance with that of professional StarCraft players.},
